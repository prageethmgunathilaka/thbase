# Action Plan for Your LLM Guardrails Startup

## Phase 1: Initial Prototype & Market Validation (2-3 months)

### 1. Rapid Prototype Development
- Build a minimal technical demo showing the core guardrails concept
- Focus on one key problem (e.g., output format enforcement)
- Use existing tools/frameworks to accelerate development
- Create a simple API or CLI interface to demonstrate functionality
- Include before/after examples with popular LLMs

### 2. Stakeholder Interviews
- Use the prototype as a conversation starter with potential customers
- Conduct 15-20 interviews with technical decision-makers
- Gather feedback on the prototype's approach and limitations
- Document specific use cases where LLM inconsistency has blocked adoption
- Identify additional requirements not addressed by the prototype

### 3. Competitive Analysis & MVP Specification
- Map current solutions addressing LLM reliability
- Identify gaps in existing tooling based on stakeholder feedback
- Define core features for the actual MVP
- Create technical specification document for the validation engine

## Phase 2: Technical Foundation (2-3 months)

### 1. Architecture Design
- Design the core validation and guardrails engine architecture
- Establish API specifications for LLM provider integrations
- Create data flow diagrams for the validation pipeline

### 2. Core Engine Development
- Implement the basic validation framework (likely in a language like Rust, Go, or Kotlin)
- Build adapters for at least two major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Develop the schema validation system for enforcing output structure

### 3. Developer Experience
- Create initial SDK for at least one programming language (Python or JavaScript)
- Build CLI tool for local testing of guardrails
- Develop documentation site with usage examples

## Phase 3: MVP Creation & Testing (2-3 months)

### 1. UI Development
- Implement key management interface for the platform
- Create visual prompt builder with basic templates
- Design analytics dashboard for tracking performance metrics

### 2. Alpha Testing
- Onboard 5-10 friendly users with real use cases
- Collect detailed feedback and usage metrics
- Iterate on core features based on initial feedback

### 3. Integration Capabilities
- Develop initial set of business system connectors
- Create webhook system for event-driven workflows
- Build error handling and retry mechanisms

## Phase 4: Go-to-Market Preparation (2 months)

### 1. Pricing Strategy
- Finalize pricing model (likely usage-based with tiered capabilities)
- Create enterprise contracting templates
- Develop ROI calculator for potential customers

### 2. Marketing Materials
- Create case studies based on alpha users
- Develop website and product demo videos
- Write technical blog posts establishing thought leadership

### 3. Sales Strategy
- Define ideal customer profile and sales process
- Build initial prospect list from interview contacts
- Create sales enablement materials

## Phase 5: Launch & Growth (Ongoing)

### 1. Public Beta Launch
- Release public beta version with documented limitations
- Implement monitoring and support systems
- Begin collecting usage metrics

### 2. Growth Marketing
- Execute content marketing strategy (blog, tutorials, etc.)
- Participate in developer and AI conferences
- Run targeted campaigns for specific verticals

### 3. Funding Strategy
- Prepare investor pitch deck with early traction metrics
- Identify target investors with relevant portfolio companies
- Consider accelerator programs specializing in AI/ML
