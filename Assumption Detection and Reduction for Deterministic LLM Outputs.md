# Assumption Detection and Reduction Framework

## Core Concept
The Assumption Detection and Reduction Framework identifies where an LLM might make assumptions in response to a prompt and helps users make those elements explicit, significantly improving output determinism.

## Why Assumptions Reduce Determinism
When LLMs encounter incomplete information, they fill gaps with assumptions based on:
1. Training data patterns
2. Statistical correlations
3. Inferred context
4. Probabilistic language modeling

These assumptions vary between runs, LLM versions, and prompt variations, creating inconsistent outputs even when the core request remains the same.

## Assumption Categories to Address

### 1. Intent Assumptions
- **What they are**: LLM guesses about the ultimate goal of the request
- **Detection approach**: Identify prompts lacking explicit purpose statements
- **Resolution strategy**: Add "The purpose of this request is to..." statements

### 2. Context Assumptions
- **What they are**: Background information the LLM infers
- **Detection approach**: Identify missing who/what/when/where information
- **Resolution strategy**: Add explicit context sections to prompts

### 3. Terminology Assumptions
- **What they are**: Interpretations of potentially ambiguous terms
- **Detection approach**: Flag industry/technical terms without definitions
- **Resolution strategy**: Include definitions for key terms

### 4. Constraint Assumptions
- **What they are**: Unstated limitations or requirements
- **Detection approach**: Identify missing boundaries, formats, or criteria
- **Resolution strategy**: Add explicit constraint statements

### 5. Audience Assumptions
- **What they are**: Inferences about who the output is for
- **Detection approach**: Check for missing audience specifications
- **Resolution strategy**: Add "This output should be appropriate for..." statements

### 6. Format Assumptions
- **What they are**: Guesses about desired output structure
- **Detection approach**: Identify prompts lacking format specifications
- **Resolution strategy**: Add explicit formatting instructions

## Implementation in the Platform

### Automated Assumption Detector
- Machine learning model trained to identify likely assumption areas
- Highlights sections of prompts where assumptions might occur
- Assigns risk scores to different assumption types
- Suggests explicit replacements for implicit elements

### Assumption-Free Template System
- Pre-built templates designed to minimize assumptions
- Structured sections for all critical information
- Required fields for commonly assumed elements
- Format-specific templates for different output types

### Determinism Score
- Quantitative measure of how likely a prompt is to produce consistent outputs
- Factors in detected assumptions and their potential impact
- Provides before/after comparison when assumptions are addressed
- Correlates with actual output consistency across multiple runs

### Interactive Assumption Resolution
- Guided interface for addressing detected assumptions
- Step-by-step questions to make implicit elements explicit
- Real-time scoring updates as assumptions are resolved
- Side-by-side comparison showing assumption impact

## Example Implementation Flow

1. User enters initial prompt
2. System analyzes and highlights potential assumption areas
3. Determinism score is calculated and displayed
4. User is guided through resolution of each flagged assumption
5. System generates "assumption-minimized" version of the prompt
6. Both versions can be tested to demonstrate consistency improvement
7. Analytics track which assumptions had the biggest impact on determinism

## Technical Approach

- Train a specialized model on labeled examples of prompts with/without assumptions
- Create a comprehensive taxonomy of common LLM assumptions
- Develop pattern matching rules for detecting common assumption indicators
- Implement before/after testing to quantify determinism improvements
- Build a continuously learning system that improves through user interactions

## Expected Outcomes

- 30-50% reduction in output variance for the same semantic request
- Significant improvement in format consistency
- More predictable handling of edge cases
- Reduced need for multiple prompt attempts
- Clearer understanding of what elements drive LLM behavior
